description: Restaurant Roulette enables users to discover local businesses in cool and fun ways.  The app has access to the Yelp API which allows the user to view businesses and give opportunities to discover new places.  Businesses can be shared via Twitter.  An Uber Estimate calculates how much an Uber cab would charge to go to the location and varies based on distance between the user location and the location of the business. <a href="https://github.com/NikShuvalov/Project_3">Click here for Repo</a>
